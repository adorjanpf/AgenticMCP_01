This contains two segements of code: a server that runs on a Raspberry pi Mini, and a client run from a windows 11 laptop. The raspberry has been physically hooked to a Ring LED, a Temperature/Humidity Sensor, and an LCD Display Screen.

With Agentic AI, you tell the client on your device something such as, "Turn the LED blue." It then communicates with the server holding the LED and makes it happen. Since the AI's resources are limited and its intelligence it low, it cannot do anything exceptionally complex, and its range of things it can do is limited by what is programmed. For instance, there is no code to allow 'make a single LED appear to 'circle around' on the ring'. However, 'display the temperature on the LCD' is well within its abilities.
